This page will explain why I will no longer use Discord and why I recommend that you follow in my footsteps.<br>
First of all, Discord requires the "users" to run a nonfree client. This means that the "user" does not have the freedom to modify the client nor to audit the source code to make sure nothing bad is happening.<br>
To many people, including Richard Stallman, this makes Discord malware. Richard Stallman has written his own page explaining <a href="https://stallman.org/discord.html">why you shouldnt use Discord</a> which I recommend reading, as this page is inspired by it.<br>
Furthermore, Discord is a data harvesting factory. The amount of data they collect unnecessarily is insane, this can be seen if you request your data package from Discord.<br>
This shows they collect all sorts of information, from all the messages you have ever sent to all the games you have played while having Discord open.<br>
Discord DMs are NOT end-to-end encrypted, therefore by my logic, they arent actually DMs (direct messages), since direct implies that only the intended recipient can see the message and choose to further share that message or not. But with Discord, this isnt the case since a malicous actor could theorectically read your messages, without the recipient nor you knowing or allowing it.<br>
<br>
Therefore, I would appreciate it if people attempting to contact me could use <a href="https://matrix.org/">Matrix</a> which is an open source standard, which actually employs end-to-end encryption.<br>
On Matrix, I am <b>@j1233:matrix.org</b>.<br>
<br>
I will however, still keep my Discord account open for now, due to the large amount of people with which it is my only means of communication. I hope more of these people will move to other, libre platforms, which support end-to-end encryption. Then, I will be willing to delete my Discord account.<br>

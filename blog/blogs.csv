Hello World!|31 August 2021|This is my first ever blog and is sort of just a test.
Blog finally working|31 August 2021|I am so happy this basic blog system is finally working as i have spent more than two hours trying to get it to work, more than one of those two hours was spent trying to use Github Actions to setup Node.js and install the fs(file system) package so i could make it create a new html file for each blog but that didnt seem to be working. I will briefly explain how everything is currently working(i use github pages to host this website btw), all the blogs (along with their set number, date and title) are currently stored in a csv file and that file is read and it adds all the titles to the blog page, these are actually buttons that can be clicked on. When a button is clicked, it changes the page so instead of all the blog's titles, it has the blog that you clicked on's title and date and just under that, the actual blog. To make a new blog post, i have to edit the csv file, which i admit, is a tad annoying but i can deal with it. Anyways, that is all i can think of. Thanks for reading. :) .
